      <h2>What is RoboSub?</h2>
      <p class="sec-text right">The <a href="https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub">International RoboSub Competition</a> requires students ranging from middle school students to college graduates to build a fully autonomous submarine. </p>
      <p class="sec-text right">The subs are required to run through an underwater obstacle course and complete task all on its own, without external help from anyone. Some of the task include moving through gates, bumping into colored buoys in a specific order, picking up and placing objects, firing torpedoes through targets, detect the location of pingers etc. </p>
      <p class="sec-text right">The competition takes place during the last week of July in the SSC Pacific Transdec, a Navel test facility in San Diego.</p>

      <h2 class="left">What We Do</h2>
      <p class="sec-text left">The UCR RoboSub team is an <a href="http://ieee.ee.ucr.edu/">IEEE </a> project. After 5 days of debugging, quick fixes, and countless training runs, we qualified for semi-finals and placed 14th out of 50 schools as our final ranking.</p>
      <p class="sec-text left">Our team consists of 4 branches: 
      <ul class="sec-text">
        <li>Mechanical</li>
        <li>Electrical</li>
        <li>Software</li>
        <li>Business</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="sec-text left">Last competition we only had about 10 members; this year we have grown to 25+ members.</p>

        <h3 class="team-name">Mechanical</h3>
        <p class="team-desc">The Mechanical team is responsible for building the submarine. They design parts such as the chassis, torpedoes and drop weights using SolidWorks and manufacture most of these parts with a 3D printer.</p>

        <h3 class="team-name">Electrical</h3>
        <p class="team-desc">The Electrical team is in charge of power management and signal processing from all of the sensors and motors. They work with temperature sensors, pressure sensors, IMUs, microcontrollers, cameras, and hydrophones.</p>

        <h3 class="team-name">Software</h3>
        <p class="team-desc">The Software team utilizes C++ and Python to program the submarine to recognize each task either visually (with a camera) or acoustically (with hydrophones). The Software team also has to program the sub to perform each task once the sub has recognized them. They work with STM32 microcontrollers and an Intel NUC.</p>
